This project is my bachelor/engineer diploma work made in late 2012 and sucessfuly defneded in march 2013 with best mark.
Although this game is made using OpenGL 2 specification, it was only due to my quite archaic hardware at the time which did not support newer OpenGL very well.

Also in mid 2013 I suffered hard disk failure and I lost every further improvements like billboarding and sprites support. So I didn't do anything more with it.

Now the roadmap for this project is:
1: port away all OpenGL 2 into newer version or to Vulkan
